# Explaining Relationships Between Academic Documents

This repository contains the practical implementations corresponding to the graduate thesis **"Explaining Relationships Between Academic Documents Using Generative Transformer Models"** as part of the *MSc. Data Science in Business and Economics* at the *University of TÃ¼bingen*. In this work, amongst others, a novel conditional context representation for the two papers is proposed and evaluated across several state-of-the-art Transformer language models. A schematic overview of this new method is shown below.

The demo notebook [**demo_notebook.ipynb**](https://github.com/timbuendert/relationship_explanation/blob/main/demo_notebook.ipynb) contains an exemplary application of the methods discussed and developed in the corresponding paper and invites for further experiments. To use it and experiment with the fine-tuned models, please download the corresponding Python module <b>relationship_explanation</b> from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uGxfWfnK_PtNfKEfuc2EbCuEQpZpjnQJ?usp=sharing).


Generally, to use the provided scripts, please create a new `Python 3` environment and execute the following command to to install all packages and dependencies.
