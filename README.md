# Explaining Relationships Between Academic Documents

This repository contains the practical implementations of the graduate thesis **"Explaining Relationships Between Academic Documents Using Generative Transformer Models"** as part of the *MSc. Data Science in Business and Economics* at *University of TÃ¼bingen*. In this work, a novel conditional context representation for the two papers is proposed which is evaluated across several state-of-the-art Transformer language models. For more details, please [contact me](mailto:tim.moritz.buendert@googlemail.com) to receive the entire thesis.

To use the provided scripts, please create a new `Python 3` environment and execute the following command to to install all packages and dependencies.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Apart from the provided scripts, larger data files are made available in a corresponding [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uGxfWfnK_PtNfKEfuc2EbCuEQpZpjnQJ?usp=sharing). This includes the pre-trained **dygie** model `scierc.tar.gz`, the pre-trained joint tagger from the *CORWA* pipeline as well as the **scigen** and **scigpt2** folders
