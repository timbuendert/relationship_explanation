# Explaining Relationships Between Academic Documents

This repository contains the practical implementations corresponding to the graduate thesis **"Explaining Relationships Between Academic Documents Using Generative Transformer Models"** as part of the *MSc. Data Science in Business and Economics* at the *University of TÃ¼bingen*. In this work, amongst others, a novel conditional context representation for the two papers is proposed and evaluated across several state-of-the-art Transformer language models. For more details, please [contact me](mailto:tim.moritz.buendert@googlemail.com) to receive the entire thesis.

The folder **demo** contains a [demo notebook](https://github.com/timbuendert/relationship_explanation/blob/main/demo/explaining_relationships.ipynb) with a practical implementation of the developed methods and invites for further experiments. For more details, please refer to the corresponding folder.
