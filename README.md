# Explaining Relationships Between Academic Documents

This repository contains the practical implementations of the graduate thesis **"Explaining Relationships Between Academic Documents Using Generative Transformer Models"** as part of the *MSc. Data Science in Business and Economics* at *University of TÃ¼bingen*. In this work, a novel conditional context representation for the two papers is proposed which is evaluated across several state-of-the-art Transformer language models. For more details, please [contact me](mailto:tim.moritz.buendert@googlemail.com) to receive the entire thesis.
